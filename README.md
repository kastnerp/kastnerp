Patrick Kastner is a researcher and educator specializing in environmental performance simulation and decarbonization of buildings and cities. He is an Assistant Professor at the School of Architecture and Director of the [Sustainable Urban Systems Lab](https://sustain.arch.gatech.edu).

As a systems engineer, his goal is to empower urban decision-makers with software tools that place sustainability at the forefront of the profession. He leads a Vertically Integrated Project titled _Surrogate Modeling for Urban Regeneration_ ([SMUR](https://vip-smur.github.io/)), which attracts a diverse group of students ranging from sophomore to graduate level, representing various engineering disciplines and other related fields across Georgia Tech.

He earned his Ph.D. and M.S. in [Systems Science and Engineering](https://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/se/programs/systems-phd) from Cornell University in 2022. During his doctoral research, he developed [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com/), a microclimate modeling software toolkit for Rhino & Grasshopper, now adopted by leading institutions in both academia and practice. He previously taught at Cornell and UPenn.

Originally from Germany, Kastner holds an M.S. in [Sustainable Building Science](https://www.ed.tum.de/en/ed/studies/degree-programs/resource-efficient-and-sustainable-building-m-sc/) from TU Munich, and a B.S. in [Energy Engineering](https://www.et.studium.fau.de/) from FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. While in Munich, he was fortunate enough to study at the [Center for Digital Technology and Management](https://www.cdtm.de/cdtm_team/patrick-kastner/) and enjoyed his time leading the operations team at [TEDxTUM](https://www.tedxtum.com/).
